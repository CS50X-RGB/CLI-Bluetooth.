## Project Overview

Our project aims to create a CLI-based file sharing solution using Node.js and Socket.io. The idea is to establish a connection between two devices using Socket.io and enable users to share files seamlessly through this connection. Let's learn and contribute to open source by enhancing this project!

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CLI-Bluetooth.git
   
2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

    ```
    cd CLI-Bluetooth
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the Server**: Start the server by running the following command:

    ```
    node server.js
    ```

4. **Run the Client**: In a separate terminal, run the client by providing the path to the file(s) you want to share:

    ```
    node client.js /path/to/your/file1 /path/to/your/file2
    ```

You can specify one or more file paths to share multiple files simultaneously.

## Usage Instructions

To use the CLI menu, follow these simple steps:

1. **Installation**: Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your working directory to the project folder.

    ```bash
    cd your-repo
    ```

4. **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary dependencies using npm.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

5. **Run the CLI Menu**: Start the CLI menu by running the following command:

    ```bash
    node CLI_MENU.mjs
    ```

6. **Interact with the Menu**: The CLI menu will be displayed with two options:
   - "Send file": Select this option to send a file. You will be prompted to input enter your name.
   - "Exit": Select this option to exit the CLI menu.

7. **File Sending (Simulated)**: If you choose to send a file, the program will simulate sending the file.

8. **Enter Your Name**: When prompted, enter your name. The program will simulate storing your name.

9. **Exiting the Menu**: To exit the menu, select the "Exit" option.

That's it! You can now interact with the CLI menu and explore its functionality.

Feel free to adapt these instructions to fit your specific project and CLI menu implementation.
   
## Current Progress

As of now, we have implemented the functionality to store files using `server.js`. However, there is more work to be done to make this project fully functional and user-friendly.

## What We Need

We are looking for contributors to help us achieve the following goals:

1. **Connect Multiple Users in the CLI**: We need to enhance the project to support multiple users simultaneously connecting and sharing files through the CLI.

2. **Deployment**: Deploy our project so that it can be easily accessed and used by a wider audience.
