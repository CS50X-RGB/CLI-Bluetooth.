## Project Overview

Our project aims to create a CLI-based file sharing solution using Node.js and Socket.io. The idea is to establish a connection between two devices using Socket.io and enable users to share files seamlessly through this connection. Let's learn and contribute to open source by enhancing this project!

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CLI-Bluetooth.git
   
2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

    ```
    cd CLI-Bluetooth
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the Server**: Start the server by running the following command:

    ```
    node server.js
    ```

4. **Run the Client**: In a separate terminal, run the client by providing the path to the file(s) you want to share:

    ```
    node client.js /path/to/your/file1 /path/to/your/file2
    ```

You can specify one or more file paths to share multiple files simultaneously.
   
## Current Progress

As of now, we have implemented the functionality to store files using `server.js`. However, there is more work to be done to make this project fully functional and user-friendly.

## What We Need

We are looking for contributors to help us achieve the following goals:

1. **Connect Multiple Users in the CLI**: We need to enhance the project to support multiple users simultaneously connecting and sharing files through the CLI.

2. **Deployment**: Deploy our project so that it can be easily accessed and used by a wider audience.
