## Project Overview

Our project aims to create a CLI-based file sharing solution using Node.js and Socket.io. The idea is to establish a connection between two devices using Socket.io and enable users to share files seamlessly through this connection. Let's learn and contribute to open source by enhancing this project!

## Current Progress

As of now, we have implemented the functionality to store files using `server.js`. However, there is more work to be done to make this project fully functional and user-friendly.

## What We Need

We are looking for contributors to help us achieve the following goals:

1. **Connect Multiple Users in the CLI**: We need to enhance the project to support multiple users simultaneously connecting and sharing files through the CLI.

2. **Deployment**: Deploy our project so that it can be easily accessed and used by a wider audience.
